# 👩🏽‍💻 Heydi's Data Science Portfolio
A growing collection of my data science projects.

Welcome! I'm a Master’s student in Data Science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, with a background in psychology, healthcare, and legal services. I use data to uncover insights, improve community services, and drive ethical, evidence-based decisions.

## 🌟 Featured Projects (Coming Soon)

**🧠 Adolescent Substance Use Risk Prediction + Chatbot**

Collaborated with a classmate,Luke Punturieri,to build a machine learning model that predicts the risk of adolescent substance use using behavioral and clinical data. Together, we also developed an interactive chatbot prototype that provides early interventions by delivering personalized risk results and connecting users with educational resources and support services tailored to their risk level.

**🏛️ Legislative Tracker**

After learning in a 2024 meeting that attorneys were manually tracking legislation, I designed and built the first version of a legislative tracker that automated bill lookups by entering the bill number—eliminating manual data entry and enhancing knowledge sharing across 12 regional offices.

In 2025, I collaborated with the Director of Data Analytics, Jessica Price, to further improve the tool based on feedback from the Legislative Committee at Maryland Legal Aid(MLA). The updated version includes a dynamic dashboard that visualizes all bills being monitored, MLA’s legislative priorities, and MLA’s official positions. It also features a master calendar view that automatically pulls in hearing dates along with the name of the attorney scheduled to testify—enabling more effective coordination of advocacy efforts across the organization.

**🩺 Health Disparities in the Latino Community**

Analyzed community-level data to uncover maternal and sexual health disparities in Maryland’s Latino population. Presented actionable insights to support culturally relevant healthcare outreach and policy efforts.
